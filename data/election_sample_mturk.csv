Many of us local scribes hate that crap.",thank you so much Crystal for telling us your truth and real voter suppression Crystal Mason: Arrested for Casting Provisional Ballot https://t.co/VqAgJbvGbZ via @YouTube,@KHOLMESlive @NBCLA This is what voter suppression looks like.  Hang in there folks,üí•üí•üí•Boomüí•üí•üí•üëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèº Every time there s a shooting Democrats call for gun control. Why don t they call for voter ID every time there s voter fraud.,@KamalaHarris Those dead voters are slow movers.,"Sanders needs the establishment to see him as a credible leader of the party. Running against the party (and all the anti-DNC/ rigged election  flames from surrogates) makes moderates worry that if he s the candidate, he ll be fighting Trump at a huge disadvantage.",@RevDrBarber White people are never affect by voter suppression don't include them in this,"America be vigilant. While Trump pretends to deal with coronavirus, surrogates continue plotting voter suppression, Russian interference, limiting personal rights, take over of US judicial system.","@Sultaan_of_A @ZaidJilani If there was any election rigging it was against Biden.  He got a majority of black votes in every state, and historically black neighborhoods are the ones that had the worst polling places and took up to 7 hours to cast a vote.  Bernie only has himself and his message to blame."
@RedPilledCult45 @DrSueDVM No accident.   CA voter fraud favoring Demorats has been going on for years.,"@NahBabyNah @Comey Soros Dream Team Joe Biden and HRC, Already reports of voter fraud in Texas and George would go BROKE Pushin the Buttons and Pullin the Strings!!!!","This is voter intimidation. Peruse my threads for 100s of neoliberals using voter intimidation tactics.   I've been abused, insulted and told to fuck off and kill myself for stating that since I am not a Democrat I will never vote for Biden.   #VoterSuppression   @MarkRuffalo https://t.co/J2NOAxZ3cP @fvkntk @teddy_cat1 @DavidAgStone @BrenMCO @ProudResister @JoeBiden @BernieSanders This isn t just about 4 more years with the moron in the White House. His erosion of the institution, undermining of the free press and use of DoJ and senate as partisan tools erode the fabric of the republic. But hey, we re all Trump supporters to you right?","We need them arrested TODAY and sentence to death tomorrow under special circumstances.  You see to try and fix any election is the worst kind of treason one person can ever commit and it is time to arrest and sentence these traitors to death to stop them now It is a Federal Offense to vote illegally in any Federal election.  It is also a Federal Offense to mandate, manipulate or be an accessory to and illegal Vote - including coaching or giving advise on doing so This traitor just broke a Federal law One that undermines the democracy",@ElHumanity @kai_newkirk @AdyBarkan A guy helping a homeless man fight voter suppression is disgraceful? Huh?,"What good sportmanship did Najib show? The counting and announcement of vote counts were dragged till 3-4 am last GE, voter fraud and all. Used the blackout method on GE13.   So cheating = sportmanship now? üòöüëåüèº PH people have poor sportsmanship; zero respect for the referee when the final whistle has been blown and game over. Former PM @NajibRazak is a gentleman who accepted GE14 results &amp; stepped aside. Can u imagine if Najib tried to keep voting to add more votes for BN in GE14? https://t.co/bdg2GDBJbA","@CoryBooker This IS voter suppression, of course there are MANY voters who simply cannot stand in line for 7 hours. Many voters had to get to work, get kids safe and fed, simply cannot physically stand that long.",Not realizing these are jokes is almost as dumb as Trump supporters thinking Garth Brooks was supporting Bernie because they forgot that Barry Sanders jerseys exist. Bernie supporters did their part in voter suppression to the max #RiggedPrimary #bernieorbust https://t.co/X1KOn6OMtL,"Well, it only took a day, but the self-reflection of Bernie supporters has shifted from ""we didn't get out and vote"" to ""voter suppression is the problem!"" They are right, and totally wrong as well.","@GregMolidor Come to think about it, most of those imaginary rally-goers will probably vote for Trump. (Trump loves projecting his crimes upon others, so ballot box stuffing would not be difficult to believe)"
